# **Credit Risk Default Prediction**

## **Project Overview**
This project aims to predict loan defaults and segment customers for a mid-sized bank using machine learning and data analysis. The goal is to identify high-risk customers, optimize loan approval processes, and enhance targeted marketing strategies.

---

## **Features and Highlights**
- **Predictive Model:** Built a Logistic Regression model with near-perfect accuracy and interpretability to predict loan default risks.
- **Customer Segmentation:** Clustered customers into four distinct groups based on account balance, income, and credit score to personalize marketing strategies.
- **Behavioral Insights:** Analyzed transaction patterns, loan types, and demographics to identify key drivers of defaults.
- **Actionable Recommendations:** Developed data-driven strategies to reduce defaults and enhance customer engagement.

---

## **Key Findings**
- **High-Risk Groups:** Young customers (18â€“25 years old), low-income groups, and customers with credit scores below 700 are more likely to default.
- **Loan Characteristics:** Smaller loans and shorter terms are linked to higher default rates.
- **Segmentation Insights:**
  - Cluster 2: Highest default rate (100%) with low balances and poor credit scores.
  - Cluster 3: No defaults, high balances, and excellent credit scores.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Languages and Tools:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Algorithms:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost
- **Clustering:** K-Means for customer segmentation
- **Visualization:** Heatmaps, scatter plots, bar charts, and KDE plots

## **Results**
- **Accuracy:** Achieved 99.8% accuracy with Logistic Regression.
- **ROC AUC:** Perfect score of 1.0 across most models.
- **Key Predictors:** Credit Score, Account Balance, Loan Amount, and Income.
